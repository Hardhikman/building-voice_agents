        "summary": "Variables are like labeled containers that store values in your program. Think of them as boxes with names on them - you can put data inside, change what's in the box, or look at what's stored there anytime. For example, 'age = 25' creates a variable called 'age' that holds the number 25. Variables are useful because they let you reuse values throughout your code, make your code more readable, and allow your program to work with changing data.",

        "summary": "Loops let you repeat an action multiple times without writing the same code over and over. There are two main types: 'for loops' which repeat a specific number of times (like counting from 1 to 10), and 'while loops' which keep repeating as long as a condition is true (like 'while the user hasn't pressed quit'). For loops are great when you know exactly how many times to repeat, while while loops are better when you need to keep going until something happens.",

        "summary": "Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. Think of them as mini-programs within your program. You define a function once with a name and instructions, then you can 'call' it by name whenever you need it. Functions can take inputs (called parameters) and return outputs (results). They help organize your code, avoid repetition, and make complex programs easier to understand and maintain.",

        "title": "Conditional Statements",
        "summary": "Conditional statements let your program make decisions based on whether something is true or false. The most common is the 'if' statement, which runs certain code only when a condition is met. You can also use 'else' to specify what happens when the condition is false, and 'elif' (else if) to check multiple conditions in sequence. Conditionals are essential for creating programs that respond differently to different situations.",

        "summary": "Data types define what kind of information a variable can hold. Common types include integers (whole numbers like 5), floats (decimal numbers like 3.14), strings (text like 'hello'), and booleans (true or false). Each type has different operations you can perform - you can add numbers, combine strings, or compare booleans. Understanding data types helps you avoid errors and use the right operations for your data.",

        "summary": "Lists (or arrays) are collections that store multiple values in a single variable. Instead of creating separate variables for each item, you can group related items together. For example, a list of student names or a collection of test scores. You can access individual items by their position (index), add new items, remove items, or loop through all items. Lists are fundamental for working with collections of data.",
